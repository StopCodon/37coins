The web-service verifies, independently from the gateway, and then publishes the transaction to the Bitcoin network. It may seem complicated, but for the end-user it‚Äôs really as simple as sending an SMS. And it is secure because we use the phone‚Äôs SIM identification through the SMS channel; and, if necessary, we use a Secret PIN as another identifier.
