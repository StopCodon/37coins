              <p>‘SMSwallet’ is a simple way to send bitcoins to anyone's mobile phone number, even international phone numbers. Gateways connect a country's SMS-network to the Bitcoin network.

              <strong>Sending between SMSwallet users</strong>
              <p>Right now there is only a fee for transactions that are initiated with the SEND command. These fees are set by the SMSgateway operators and reflect the cost of operating in their country (and market competition). Currently there is no fee for use of the Security PIN feature.</p>
              <p>The sender always pays the transaction fee and is assessed from the sender's gateway operator. So, the fee is the same if you send bitcoins to a domestic phone number or an international phone number.</p>
              <strong>Sending to a Bitcoin address</strong>
              <p>If sending to an external Bitcoin address, there will be an additional Blockchain transaction fee, in addition to the gateway fee. The Blockchain transaction fee depends on the size of the transaction.</p>

On your first bitcoin deposit, your total balance will be adjusted to reflect the account activation fee.</p>

              <p>No, if you just want to open a wallet, just choose a gateway from your country and send a text message to it. Opening an SMSgateway will not give you an SMSwallet.</p>
              <p>If no gateway exists in your country, think about opening one. It will allow people to use your gateway's phone number to open wallets and send to international phone number or bitcoin address. Also, you will earn the fees for transactions through your gateway. Once again, if you open a gateway, and you want to open an SMSwallet, you will need another phone.

              <p>SMSwallet operates on a shared responsibility model and multi-factor authentication for security. To protect the SMSwallets from spoofing, the SMSgateways sends a challenge back to the phone to verify the request. Then a transaction is constructed and signed with the SMSgateway’s private key. The input(s) to this transaction is not spendable without the signature of both, the gateway and the web-service. For large value transactions, the web-service initiates a voice-call with the client to verify the client's spending PIN. Instead of confirming the message via SMS/text, you enter a Secret PIN with dial-tones via a voice call. Once successful, the web-service adds its part of the signature and the transaction can be spent. Throughout the process, the client is required to verify the possession of the phone as well as the knowledge of the spending PIN, giving him two factors for authentication. In other words, IMSI-catcher would be ineffective in Security PIN protected transactions. </p>
              <div class="alert alert-warning">However, in the current MVP implementation no shared responsibility model is implemented yet. The gateway is dumb and the web-service has to be fully trusted.</div>
